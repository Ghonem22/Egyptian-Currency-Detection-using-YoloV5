# Egyptian-Currency-Detection-using-YoloV5
  Using artificially Generated currency Dataset with YoloV5 to build currency detection model 

## Dataset
   you will find the generated dataset in this link:
      https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-1fHYR2hm1FcvflfbhDEIoICin7eFYwq/view?usp=sharing



#### How to use this dataset from drive directly through "YOLOv5_Currency_detection.ipynb":

   1- open the link, select "Add shortcut to drive".
   2- select a place to add the shortcut in.
   3- open the notebook, mount your drive, and then you will find the shortcut of the zipped file at the place you selected.
   4- now, you can unzip the dataset and start working on it.
    
#### You should notice some points::

   1- this dataset is artifically generated using python script, it won't be realistic, but its result will be kind of good. 
   2- You can enhance the results with very little realistic dataset by building on the model you trained using the generated dataset.
   3- there are some techniques we can use with the generation code to get a realistic generated dataset as possible.

## Trained Model
   You can Download and use the trained model directly from this drice link:
      https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KY1TLtGI0l8gb7N8PMag2yQv2nPaGrB7/view?usp=sharing

#### Given That:
   This model is trained for 20 epoch only, you can't rely on its results.
